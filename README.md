# Convert Classic Editor to Gutenberg Blocks

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This is a beta version of a GB Script Plugin. Use it for contributions only. Get stable version [here](#).


Welcome to the GB Script Plugin repository on GitHub. Get a dive into the source, open issues and contribute! This plugin is useful to convert your Classic Editor Post/Page to Gutenberg Blocks automatically!

## Why we Started 

It is a great idea to switch to Gutenberg Editor. But, when you switch to Gutenberg Editor, the content of classic editor will not be editable with the new Editor. To make it work, it is required to convert your content to Gutenberg compatible block. That is the problem we are trying to solve with the "Convert Classic Editor to Gutenberg Blocks" script. üí≠


Let's have a look at how to use this plugin.

## How to Use

### Step 1

Download, install & activate a required plugin, Multipurpose Gutenberg Block from [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multipurpose-block/).

### Step 2

Download, install & activate GB Script Plugin from [here](#).

### Step 3

Activating these 2 plugins will enable a new button ‚ÄúConvert to Gutenberg Blocks‚Äù at the top of editor screen for every Post or Page. Go to the post/page with classic editor content and click on this button.

### Step 4

A new clone of post/page will be created as a draft and converted into the Gutenberg Blocks.

### Step 5

If you like the new draft, just copy and use the title and slug from the Original post to the new Gutenberg post and delete the original post. You can now publish your new Gutenberg post.
